The easiest way to get started with AWS CodePipeline is to use the Create Pipeline wizard in the AWS CodePipeline console to create a simple pipeline.

In this tutorial, you will use AWS CodePipeline to deploy code that is maintained in an AWS CodeCommit repository to a single Amazon EC2 instance. You will use AWS CodeDeploy as the deployment service.

Not what you're looking for? To create a simple pipeline using a versioned Amazon S3 bucket as a code repository, see Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline (Amazon S3 Bucket).

After you complete this tutorial, you should have enough practice with AWS CodeCommit concepts to use it as a repository in your pipelines.

AWS CodePipeline uses Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect changes in your AWS CodeCommit source repository and branch. Using Amazon CloudWatch Events to automatically start your pipeline when changes occur is the default for this source type. When you create a pipeline in this wizard using the console, the rule is created.

Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following tasks:

Configure an IAM user
Install and configure the AWS CLI
Create your key pair using Amazon EC2
In addition, make sure to complete these service-specific tasks:

AWS CodeCommit: Install Git and configure credentials
AWS CodeDeploy: Create an IAM instance profile and an AWS CodeDeploy service role
AWS CodePipeline: Assign AWS CodePipeline permissions to the IAM user role
Note
If you have already completed the Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline (Amazon S3 Bucket) tutorial, but not yet cleaned up its resources, you will need to create different names for many of the resources you used in that tutorial. For example, instead of MyFirstPipeline, you might name your pipeline MySecondPipeline.

Step 1: Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository and Local Repo

To start this tutorial, you will create a repository in AWS CodeCommit. Your pipeline will get source code from this repository when it runs. You will also create a local repository where you maintain and update code before pushing it to the AWS CodeCommit repository.

Important
AWS CodeCommit is currently supported for pipelines in the following regions only:
US East (Ohio) Region (us-east-2)
US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1)
US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-2)
EU (Ireland) Region (eu-west-1)
South America (São Paulo) Region (sa-east-1)
Be sure to complete all of the steps in this tutorial with one of these AWS regions selected.
Follow the first two procedures in the Git with AWS CodeCommit Tutorial in the AWS CodeCommit User Guide:

Step 1: Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository
Step 2: Create a Local Repo
Note
For information about connecting to a local repo you create, see Connect to an AWS CodeCommit Repository.
After you complete these two procedures, return to this page and continue to the next step. Do not continue to the third step in the AWS CodeCommit tutorial. You will complete different steps in this tutorial instead.

Step 2: Add Sample Code to Your AWS CodeCommit Repository

In this step, you will download code for a sample application that was created for an AWS CodeDeploy sample walkthrough, and add it to your AWS CodeCommit repository.

Download the following file:

SampleApp_Linux.zip.
Unzip the files from SampleApp_Linux.zip into the local directory you created in the previous procedure (for example, /tmp/my-demo-repo or c:\temp\my-demo-repo).

Be sure to place the files directly into your local repository. Do not include a SampleApp_Linux folder. On your local Linux, macOS, or Unix machine, for example, your directory and file hierarchy should look like this:

Copy
/tmp
  |my-demo-repo
    |-- appspec.yml
    |-- index.html
    |-- LICENSE.txt
    `-- scripts
      |-- install_dependencies
      |-- start_server
      `-- stop_server
Change directories to your local repo:

Copy
(For Linux, macOS, or Unix) cd /tmp/my-demo-repo
(For Windows) cd c:\temp\my-demo-repo
Run the following command to stage all of your files at once:

Copy
git add -A
Run the following command to commit the files with a commit message:

Copy
git commit -m "Added sample application files"
Run the following command to push the files from your local repo to your AWS CodeCommit repository:

Copy
git push
The files you downloaded and added to your local repo have now been added to the master branch in your AWS CodeCommit MyDemoRepo repository and are ready to be included in a pipeline.

Step 3: Create an Amazon EC2 Instance and Install the AWS CodeDeploy Agent

In this step, you will create the Amazon EC2 instance to which you will deploy a sample application. As part of this process, you will install the AWS CodeDeploy agent on the instance. The AWS CodeDeploy agent is a software package that enables an instance to be used in AWS CodeDeploy deployments.

To launch an instance

Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

From the console dashboard, choose Launch Instance.

On the Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) page, locate the row for the HVM edition of the Amazon Linux AMI, and then choose Select. (This AMI is labeled "Free tier eligible" and can be found at the top of the list.)

Note
These basic configurations, called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), serve as templates for your instance. This tutorial can be completed with any of the free tier eligible AMIs. For simplicity, we will use the HVM edition of the Amazon Linux AMI.
On the Step 2: Choose an Instance Type page, choose the free tier eligible t2.micro type as the hardware configuration for your instance, and then choose Next: Configure Instance Details.

On the Step 3: Configure Instance Details page, do the following:

In Number of instances, enter 1.
In Auto-assign Public IP, choose Enable.
In IAM role, choose an IAM role that has been configured for use as an IAM instance profile for use with AWS CodeDeploy. If you do not have an IAM instance profile, choose Create new IAM role and follow the instructions in Create an IAM Instance Profile for Your Amazon EC2 Instances.
Note
For the purposes of this tutorial, you can use the following unrestricted policy in your IAM instance profile for AWS CodeDeploy. For pipelines you use in your development workflows, you might create a more restrictive bucket policy.
Copy
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
On the Step 3: Configure Instance Details page, expand Advanced Details, and in the User data field, type the following:

Copy
#!/bin/bash
yum -y update
yum install -y ruby
yum install -y aws-cli
cd /home/ec2-user
aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-2/latest/install . --region us-east-2
chmod +x ./install
./install auto
This code will install the AWS CodeDeploy agent on your instance as it is created. If you prefer, you can connect to your Linux instance using SSH and install the AWS CodeDeploy agent manually after the instance is created.

Leave the rest of the items on the Step 3: Configure Instance Details page unchanged. Choose Next: Add Storage, leave the Step 4: Add Storage page unchanged, and then choose Next: Add Tags.

On the Add Tags page, with Name displayed in the Key box, type MyCodePipelineDemo in the Value box, and then choose Next: Configure Security Group.

Important
The Key and Value boxes are case-sensitive.
On the Step 6: Configure Security Group page, do the following:

Next to Assign a security group, choose Create a new security group.
In the row for SSH, under Source, choose My IP.
Choose Add Rule, choose HTTP, and then under Source, choose My IP.
Choose Review and Launch.

On the Review Instance Launch page, choose Launch, and then do one of the following when prompted for a key pair:

If you already have a key pair to use with Amazon EC2 instances, select Choose an existing key pair, and then select your key pair.
If you have not created a key pair yet, select Create a new key pair, enter a name for the key pair, and then choose Download Key Pair. This is your only chance to save the private key file. Be sure to download it. Save the private key file in a safe place. You'll need to provide the name of your key pair when you launch an instance; you'll need to provide the corresponding private key each time you connect to the instance. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs.
Warning
Don't select the Proceed without a key pair option. If you launch your instance without a key pair, you can't connect to it if you need to troubleshoot issues with the AWS CodeDeploy agent.
When you are ready, select the acknowledgement check box, and then choose Launch Instances.

Choose View Instances to close the confirmation page and return to the console.

You can view the status of the launch on the Instances page. When you launch an instance, its initial state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running, and it receives a public DNS name. (If the Public DNS column is not displayed, choose the Show/Hide icon, and then select Public DNS.)

It can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready for you to connect to it. Check that your instance has passed its status checks. You can view this information in the Status Checks column.

If you want to confirm that the AWS CodeDeploy agent is configured correctly, you can connect to your Linux instance using SSH and then verify the AWS CodeDeploy agent is running.

Step 4: Create an Application in AWS CodeDeploy

In AWS CodeDeploy, an application is an identifier, in the form of a name, for the code you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment. You will select the name of the AWS CodeDeploy application you create in this step when you create your pipeline later in this tutorial.

To create an application in AWS CodeDeploy

Open the AWS CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.

If the Applications page does not appear, on the AWS CodeDeploy menu, choose Applications.

Choose Create application.

In the Application name box, type MyDemoApplication.

In the Deployment group name box, type MyDemoDeploymentGroup.

In the Search by tags list, select the Amazon EC2 tag type, choose Name in the Key box, and in the Value box, type MyCodePipelineDemo.

Important
You must choose the same value for the Name key here that you assigned to your Amazon EC2 instance when you created it. If you tagged your instance with something other than MyCodePipelineDemo, be sure to use it here.
In the Deployment configuration list, choose CodeDeployDefault.OneAtaTime.

In the Service role ARN box, choose an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a service role that trusts AWS CodeDeploy with, at minimum, the trust and permissions described in Create a Service Role for AWS CodeDeploy. To get the service role ARN, see Get the Service Role ARN (Console).

Choose Create application.

Step 5: Create Your First Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline

You're now ready to create and run your first pipeline.

To create an AWS CodePipeline automated release process

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CodePipeline console at http://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline.

On the introductory page, choose Get started.

If you see the All pipelines page, choose Create pipeline.

In Step 1: Name, in Pipeline name, type MyFirstPipeline, and then choose Next step.

Note
If you choose another name for your pipeline, be sure to use it instead of MyFirstPipeline in the remaining steps of this tutorial. After you create a pipeline, you cannot change its name. Pipeline names are subject to some limitations. For more information, see Limits in AWS CodePipeline.
In Step 2: Source, in Source provider, choose AWS CodeCommit. In Repository name, choose the name of the AWS CodeCommit repository you created in Step 1: Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository and Local Repo. In Branch name, choose the name of the branch that contains your latest code update. Unless you created a different branch on your own, only master will be available.

Choose Next step.


            The Step 2: Source page in the AWS CodePipeline pipeline
              wizard
          
After you select the repository name and branch, you'll see a message showing the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that will be created for this pipeline.

Under Change detection options, leave the defaults. This allows AWS CodePipeline to use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect changes in your source repository.

In Step 3: Build, choose No Build, and then choose Next step.

Note
In this tutorial, you are deploying code that requires no build service.
In Step 4: Deploy, in Deployment provider, choose AWS CodeDeploy. In Application name, type MyDemoApplication, or choose the Refresh button, and then choose the application name from the list. In Deployment group, type MyDemoDeploymentGroup, or choose it from the list, and then choose Next step.


            The Step 4: Deploy page in the AWS CodePipeline pipeline
              wizard
          
Note
The name "Staging" is the name given by default to the stage created in the Step 4: Deploy step, just as "Source" is the name given to the first stage of the pipeline.
In Step 5: Service Role, you will choose the IAM role to give AWS CodePipeline permission to use resources in your account. Service role creation is only required the first time you create a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

If you have not already created a service role for AWS CodePipeline:

Choose Create role.

On the IAM console page that describes the AWS-CodePipeline-Service role that will be created for you, choose Allow. After you create the role, AWS-CodePipeline-Service will appear in Role name on the Step 5: Service Role page.

Choose Next step.

If you already have a service role for AWS CodePipeline, you must ensure that it includes the permissions needed to work with AWS CodeCommit. If your service role was created after April 18, 2016, it includes the necessary permissions. If it was created on or before April 18, 2016, you may need to follow these steps:

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

In the IAM console, in the navigation pane, choose Roles, and then choose your AWS-CodePipeline-Service role from the list of roles.

On the Permissions tab, in Inline Policies, in the row for your service role policy, choose Edit Policy.

Note
Your service role has a name in a format similar to oneClick_AWS-CodePipeline-1111222233334.
In the Policy Document box, add the following to your policy statement:

Copy
{
  "Action": [  
      "codecommit:GetBranch",
      "codecommit:GetCommit",
      "codecommit:UploadArchive",
      "codecommit:GetUploadArchiveStatus",      
      "codecommit:CancelUploadArchive"
            ],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Effect": "Allow"
},
The permissions might appear in your policy document like this after you add them:


                Permissions for AWS CodeCommit in the Policy Editor
              
Choose Validate Policy to ensure the policy contains no errors. When the policy is error-free, choose Apply Policy.

In the Step 5: Service Role page, in Role name, choose the name of your service role for AWS CodePipeline.

Because the drop-down list will display all IAM service roles associated with your account, if you choose a name different from the default, be sure that the name is recognizable as the service role for AWS CodePipeline.

Choose Next step.

In Step 6: Review, review the information, and then choose Create pipeline.

The pipeline automatically starts to run. You can view progress and success and failure messages as the AWS CodePipeline sample deploys the web page to the Amazon EC2 instance in the AWS CodeDeploy deployment.


            A view of a pipeline beginning to run in the AWS CodePipeline console.
          
Congratulations! You just created a simple pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline has two stages: a source stage named Source, which detects changes in the sample application stored in the AWS CodeCommit repository and pulls those changes into the pipeline, and a Staging stage that deploys those changes to the Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CodeDeploy. Next, you will verify the results.

To verify that your pipeline ran successfully

View the initial progress of the pipeline. The status of each stage will change from No executions yet to In Progress, and then to either Succeeded or Failed. The pipeline should complete the first run within a few minutes.

After the pipeline status displays Succeeded, in the status area for the Staging stage, choose Details.

In the AWS CodeDeploy console, in Deployment Details, in Instance ID, choose the instance ID of the successfully deployed instance.

On the Description tab, in Public DNS, copy the address, and then paste it into the address bar of your web browser.

This is the sample application you downloaded and pushed to your AWS CodeCommit repository.

              repository.
          
For more information about stages, actions, and how pipelines work, see AWS CodePipeline Concepts.

Step 6: Modify Code in Your AWS CodeCommit Repository

In this step, you will make changes to the HTML file that is part of the sample AWS CodeDeploy application you deployed to your Amazon EC2 instance. When your pipeline runs again later in this tutorial, the changes you make will be visible at the http://PublicDNS URLs.

Change directories to your local repo:

Copy
(For Linux, macOS, or Unix) cd /tmp/my-demo-repo
(For Windows) cd c:\temp\my-demo-repo
Use a text editor to modify the index.html file:

Copy
(For Linux or Unix)gedit index.html
(For OS X)open –e index.html
(For Windows)notepad index.html
Revise the contents of the index.html file to change the background color and some of the text on the web page, and then save the file.

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Updated Sample Deployment</title>
  <style>
    body {

Commit and push your changes to your AWS CodeCommit repository by running the following commands, one at a time:

Copy
git commit -am "Updated sample application files"
Copy
git push
Your pipeline is configured to run whenever code changes are made to your AWS CodeCommit repository.

To verify your pipeline ran successfully

View the initial progress of the pipeline. The status of each stage will change from No executions yet to In Progress, and then to either Succeeded or Failed. The pipeline should complete within a few minutes.

After the action status displays Succeeded, in the status area for the Staging stage, choose Details.

In the Deployment Details section, in Instance ID, choose the instance ID of the instance.

On the Description tab, in Public DNS, copy the address, and then paste it into the address bar of your web browser.

The updated web page will be displayed:


            The updated sample web page application that was pushed to your AWS CodeCommit
              repository.
          
For more information about stages, actions, and how pipelines work, see AWS CodePipeline Concepts.

Step 7: Optional Stage Management Tasks

If you want to gain more experience working with stages before you end the tutorial, you can follow two additional procedures in the Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline (Amazon S3 Bucket).

Step 4: Add Another Stage to Your Pipeline
Disable and Enable Transitions Between Stages in AWS CodePipeline
Note
In step 4 of the second procedure, instead of uploading your sample to an Amazon S3 bucket again, as described, make a change to the sample app in your local repo and push it to your AWS CodeCommit repository.
Step 8: Clean Up Resources

You can use some of the resources you created in this tutorial for the next tutorial, Tutorial: Create a Four-Stage Pipeline. For example, you can reuse the AWS CodeDeploy application and deployment. However, after you complete this and any other tutorials, you should delete the pipeline and the resources it uses, so that you will not be charged for the continued use of those resources. First, delete the pipeline, then the AWS CodeDeploy application and its associated Amazon EC2 instance, and finally, the AWS CodeCommit repository.

To clean up the resources used in this tutorial

To clean up your AWS CodePipeline resources, follow the instructions in Delete a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

To clean up your AWS CodeDeploy resources, follow the instructions in Clean Up Deployment Walkthrough Resources.

To delete the AWS CodeCommit repository, follow the instructions in Delete an AWS CodeCommit Repository.
